A simple script to display temp (in Fahrenheit) humidity and pressure then log data to a text file.
The intent is to write various versions of this for those that use SenseHats for monitoring purposes (either for weather or for Pi stacks).

Over time I'll include other projects on this Github account as I'm learning Python.
