# Raspberry-Pi-SenseHat-Monitor-Project

This project is intended for use for anyone that has a Raspberry Pi and a Sense Hat, my initial idea was to create a scrolling temperature display with humidity percentage and pressure from the Sense Hat and have that log to a file, that was version .1, the next version grabs temperatures from the cpu by running 'vcgencmd measure temp' in the shell on the Pi. I hope to eventually graph all of the temperatures in C on the Sense Hat's 8x8 display as well as logging it all to a database.
Let me know if you have any comments, you can reach me here or on Twitter.
